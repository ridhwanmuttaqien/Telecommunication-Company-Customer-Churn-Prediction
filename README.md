The dataset that we are analyzing is customer data of a telecommunication company in California in Q2 2022 (April - June 2022). The dataset contains customer demographic data, services used, customer status at the end of Q2, and income received by the company per customer.

This project was created to analyze churn problems for customers and to model churn detection for a customer. The results of modeling detection are expected to help companies prevent customer churn before it occurs by taking an intensive approach to customers who are detected as churn.

To make it easier for companies to use the model that has been made, this project also includes a simple application link to make predictions by inputting some data about customers.
